### Greetings from Sweden! :sweden:

I'm Becki a Full Stack Developer based in Stockholm :woman_technologist:

I am a self-driven and creative problem solver with a PhD in Medical Physics and a passion for working with technology, software and cool new ideas.

While working in research I was using statistical and scripting languages (Python, SPSS, Matlab) for analysis and that inspired me to delve deeper into programming and eventually I made the leap and moved from hobby programmer to full-time developer. 

In my spare time, I like to build small applications with JavaScript, Python and Swift and take time improving my knowledge and skills in the area of machine learning and AI. I also enjoy getting involved in the community, I am a co-organiser of sthlm.js meetup group and head of events and a workshop leader for Code Excursion, an organisation that runs events and workshops aimed at getting more women into coding.

Overall, I want to work with innovative technology alongside passionate people and make a bit of a difference in the world.
